Hello! Follow the steps given below:
1. First, add the water into the pan and allow it to boil properly.
2. When it starts to boil, add the milk into the water, along with the sugar (optional).
3. Let it boil a little more, then add the tea leaves and leave the mixture to boil for a little more time, about 5-6 more minutes.
4. When it starts to rise, and the colour changes into a beautiful burnt umber colour, take it off of the stove and filter the tea using the sieve.
5. Serve, it hot with some snacks, and you have a delicious and refreshing warm tea :).
